# Microsoft 365 Administration


## Introduction
Microsoft's flagship cloud platform provides IT administrators a seamless way to manage users, resources, and services within a virtualized environment. In this lab project, I will demonstrate my proficiency in using Microsoft 365.


## Basic Account Administration 
Managing user accounts is one of the core responsibilities in Windows 365 administration. The "Users" tab is where administrators manage user accounts within the organization. It allows administrators to create, modify, and delete user profiles. Also, Administrators can assign licenses, manage roles and permissions and monitor user activity. 

Many administration tasks can be done from the user tab. I showcase my proficiency with the most common task.

The following is me performing common account administration task: 

  ## Adding Users: 
By clicking "Add  User" and filling in the required details you can create a new User

  ## Adding Groups and Members 
Groups in Microsoft 365 facilitate easier management of users by bundling multiple accounts with similar needs into a single unit. 

Click on "Teams & Group". Navigate to "Active teams & groups". Then choose what group you would like to add. Enter the details and then create a group. (My example is a  Microsoft 365 group).

## Restoring a Deleted User
Microsoft 365 offers a recovery window where deleted users can be restored without loss of data or access. By swiftly restoring deleted accounts, administrators ensure continuity of service, preventing unnecessary disruptions to business operations.

By clicking "Deleted users", select the checkbox to the user's name you would like to restore (example: Homer Simpson) and then click Restore user. Then proceed to resign any licenses and roles if needed.
