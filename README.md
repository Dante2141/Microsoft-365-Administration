# Microsoft 365 Administration


## Introduction
Microsoft's flagship cloud platform provides IT administrators a seamless way to manage users, resources, and services within a virtualized environment. In this lab project, I will demonstrate my proficiency in using Microsoft 365.


## Basic Account Administration 
Managing user accounts is one of the core responsibilities in Windows 365 administration. The "Users" tab is where administrators manage user accounts within the organization. It allows administrators to create, modify, and delete user profiles. Also, Administrators can assign licenses, manage roles and permissions and monitor user activity. 

Many administration tasks can be done from the user tab. I showcase my proficiency with the most common task.

The following is me performing common account administration task: 

  ## Adding Users: 
By clicking "Add  User" and filling in the required details you can create a new User

  ## Adding Groups and Members 
Groups in Microsoft 365 facilitate easier management of users by bundling multiple accounts with similar needs into a single unit. 

Click on "Teams & Group". Navigate to "Active teams & groups". Then choose what group you would like to add. Enter the details and then create a group. (My example is a  Microsoft 365 group).

## Restoring a Deleted User
Microsoft 365 offers a recovery window where deleted users can be restored without loss of data or access. By swiftly restoring deleted accounts, administrators ensure continuity of service, preventing unnecessary disruptions to business operations.

By clicking "Deleted users", select the checkbox to the user's name you would like to restore (example: Homer Simpson) and then click Restore user. Then proceed to resign any licenses and roles if needed.

## Exchange Administration
Exchange Online is the email service in Microsoft 365, handling emails, calendars, and contacts. Administrators are responsible for tasks like setting up mailboxes, managing email flow, and troubleshooting issues. By configuring shared mailboxes and using tools like Message Trace to track emails.

The following is me performing common Exchange administration task: 

  ## Creating Shared Mailboxes
Shared mailboxes allow multiple users to monitor and respond to communications from a single email account.

In Exchange admin center, click on "Recipients", "Mailboxes" then "Add a shared mailbox". Continue to add the details of the shared mailbox and then create.

  ## Troubleshooting with Message Trace
Message Trace is an invaluable tool within Exchange for tracking emails that flow through the organization. Whether diagnosing delivery issues or investigating potential security breaches, Message Trace allows administrators to delve into detailed logs, tracking emails from origin to destination. This troubleshooting tool aids in pinpointing delays, identifying spam filters or addressing potential unauthorized access to communications.

In Exchange admin center under "Mail flow" tab click  "Message trace", then click "Start a trace" and enter New message trace details.

## Conclusion
Microsoft 365 administration involves managing users, emails, files, and resources to keep everything running smoothly. By handling tasks like adding users, restoring deleted files, and setting up shared mailboxes, IT administrators can ensure a secure and efficient system. In this lab, I only scratched the surface of what you can do as an administrator of 365. There is so much more to this platform. Nonetheless,  I hope I was able to showcase my abilities to manage an organization through users through Microsoft 365/
