# Microsoft 365 Administration


## Introduction
Microsoft's flagship cloud platform provides IT administrators a seamless way to manage users, resources, and services within a virtualized environment. In this lab project, I will demonstrate my proficiency in using Microsoft 365.


## Basic Account Administration 
Managing user accounts is one of the core responsibilities in Windows 365 administration. The "Users" tab is where administrators manage user accounts within the organization. It allows administrators to create, modify, and delete user profiles. Also, Administrators can assign licenses, manage roles and permissions and monitor user activity. 

Many administration tasks can be done from the user tab. I showcase my proficiency with the most common task.

The following is me performing common account administration:

## What is Vulnerability Assessment?
A vulnerability assessment is a methodical process designed to identify, evaluate, and prioritize vulnerabilities within a given system. Unlike vulnerability management, which is continuous, a vulnerability assessment is usually conducted as a one-time project with a well-defined start and end date. During the assessment, security professionals use specialized tools and techniques to uncover weaknesses such as software bugs, configuration errors, or outdated patches that could serve as gateways for potential attackers.
