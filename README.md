# Microsoft-365-Administration


## Introduction
In this project, I demonstrate my vulnerability management skills by conducting various scans using Nessus a widely respected tool in cybersecurity. Vulnerability management plays a crucial role in safeguarding an organizationâ€™s infrastructure by helping to identify analyze and prioritize security flaws before they can be exploited. This project delves into the essence of vulnerability management, explains the process of vulnerability assessments and scans, and outlines a structured approach to managing vulnerabilities.


## Lab Architecture
The architecture of the Lab environment consists of the following components:

## What is Vulnerability Managment?
Vulnerability management is the systematic process of identifying, assessing, and remediating security weaknesses within an organization's infrastructure. Unlike a one-time effort, it is an ongoing, cyclical program aimed at reducing risk over time, prioritizing the most significant vulnerabilities to ensure the organization and its data remain secure. The reality is that no organization can ever fix all vulnerabilities. The goal is strategically directing resources, focusing on high-impact vulnerabilities with the most risks. By actively managing vulnerabilities, organizations create a defensive posture that mitigates the risk of cyberattacks and data breaches.

## What is Vulnerability Assessment?
A vulnerability assessment is a methodical process designed to identify, evaluate, and prioritize vulnerabilities within a given system. Unlike vulnerability management, which is continuous, a vulnerability assessment is usually conducted as a one-time project with a well-defined start and end date. During the assessment, security professionals use specialized tools and techniques to uncover weaknesses such as software bugs, configuration errors, or outdated patches that could serve as gateways for potential attackers.
