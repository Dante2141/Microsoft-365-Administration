## What is Vulnerability Assessment?
A vulnerability assessment is a methodical process designed to identify, evaluate, and prioritize vulnerabilities within a given system. Unlike vulnerability management, which is continuous, a vulnerability assessment is usually conducted as a one-time project with a well-defined start and end date. During the assessment, security professionals use specialized tools and techniques to uncover weaknesses such as software bugs, configuration errors, or outdated patches that could serve as gateways for potential attackers.
